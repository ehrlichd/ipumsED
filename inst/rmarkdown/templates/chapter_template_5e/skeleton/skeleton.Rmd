# Intro/Setup

**NOTE:** chapter templates **do not** require a yaml header (most .RMD do). 


## Tips

Lay out sections using `#` headers.

**^^^ Be sure to delete this and above before compiling bookdown. ^^^^**


# Engage

Brief example of an engaging phenomenon.
  * Poll students and discuss results
    + Does the *average* match up with individual experiences?
  * Real-world research example
  * Interrogating a commonly held assumption
    + the average height of humans is 5'5"


# Explore

conduct demo/small-scale experiment/analysis
Ask leading questions, form hypotheses; 
  * can the example be grouped / broken into subgroups
    + does the same pattern/phenomenon apply?
  * Is there a corollary / inverse phenomenon?

Pose questions to explore



Discuss/interrogate the pattern of the data
  * does the shape imply anything
  * try to have it student led / guided
  * with time, students guess at what the data shows/doesn't show without labels



# Explain - lecture/read

TEXT

# Elaborate

Work through the same process/analysis on new data. Either a different 
variable(s) in the same sample, or applying/demonstrating the phenomenon 
using real-world data/examples.


* Reiterate/reinforc the process/task of the lesson
* Does this fit in to other steps/analysis
* does this fit in to other thematic topics?

(Possibly) Build on the first one to show variation.
  * Other ways to represent the phenomenon/data
    + tabular
    + visually



# Evaluate/Exercises

Students should reproduce/apply the example from the lesson to a chosen dataset.
  * Instructor can specify 1 report for a specific combination of variables (to match an exact answer)
  * Students can choose 1 additional variable(s) to investigate in a similarly structured report
  * Students write a reflection statement/blog summarizing a key finding

 short lab exercises for students to recreate / code in R
 
 Build on past concepts reinforcing basic data maniplutaions, summaries, etc.
